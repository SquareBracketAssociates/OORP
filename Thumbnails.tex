\chapter{Thumbnail patterns}

\on{Put these in the right places:}

\label{pat:Adapter}
\label{pat:Facade}

There are many patterns that are not specifically concerned with reengineering, but are still relevant to the reengineering process. In this chapter we have listed only those patterns that are specifically referred to at some point in this book. We have grouped them into the following three categories:

\index{DeLano, David}
\index{Rising, Linda}
\index{Binder, Robert}
\begin{bulletlist}
\item \emph{Testing patterns.}
These patterns help you to focus your testing efforts. Our principle source is a pattern language by DeLano and Rising \cite{DeLa98a}, though of course a vast literature is available on the subject. Binder, for example, devotes an entire book to the subject \cite{Bind99a}.

\index{Fowler, Martin}
\index{Roberts, Donald}
\item \emph{Refactoring patterns.}
These patterns focus on individual refactoring steps that you might applying during a reengineering project, or that you might just as well apply during any forward engineering project. Our principle sources are Fowler \etal \cite{Fowl99a}, and the Roberts' PhD thesis \cite{Robe99a}.

\item \emph{Design patterns.}
Very frequently the result of a reengineering operation is to put a particular design pattern into place. Here we remind the reader of some of the most common design patterns that pop up in a reengineering context. Our main source is, of course, the \emphind{Design Patterns} book \cite{Gamm95a}.

%:THUMBNAIL -- {Retest Persistent Problems}
\thumbnail{Retest Persistent Problems}{RetestPersistentProblems}

\paragraph*{Problem:}
What areas of the system should receive concentrated testing, irrespective of the features being implemented?

\paragraph*{Solution:}
Keep a list of persistent problem areas and test cases to verify them, not just for resolving the current problems but also for use in subsequent testing. Test these areas thoroughly, even if there are no new features going into them. Retest regularly using, even one last time before the release goes out of the door.

%:THUMBNAIL -- {Test Fuzzy Features}
\thumbnail{Test Fuzzy Features}{TestFuzzyFeatures}

\paragraph*{Problem:}
How can possible problem areas of the system be pinpointed so that the most problems can be found in the least amount of time?

\paragraph*{Solution:}
Study the documentation available on the system. Look for areas that seems ambiguous or ill-defined. Write test plans that cover these areas more thoroughly and concentrate testing in these areas. If designers can tell you all about a feature, it probably works. It's what they can't tell you that needs attention during testing.

%:THUMBNAIL -- {Test Old Bugs}
\thumbnail{Test Old Bugs}{TestOldBugs}

\paragraph*{Problem:}
What areas of the system should be targeted for testing so that the most problems can be found in the least amount of time?

\paragraph*{Solution:}
Examine problem reports from previous releases to help select test cases. Since it would be inefficient to test for all old problems, look at problems reported after the last valid snapshot of the system. Categorize problem reports to see if a trend is determined that could be used for additional testing.
